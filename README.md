# GLF Features for Median Filtering Forensics

The authors of the papers [1] and [2], provide this MATLAB toolbox only for research purposes
(evaluation and comparison of this method with other methods).

It contains:

- `GLF_Chen.m`:    main function to extract the GLF feature proposed in [1] and [2]
- `example.m`:     example of use of the method
- `utilis` folder: some mex functions that are needed for GLF_Chen.
- `README.md`:     this readme info

If you have any doubts, please contact with Chenglong at c.chenglong@gmail.com.
